# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: My Chinese name is 陳韋廷. I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at the Graduate Institute of Electronic Engineering at National Taiwan University (NTU).  I am an incoming visiting student researcher at Stanford Computational Imaging Lab and collaborate with Prof. Gordon Wetzstein in 2022. My advisor is Prof. Sy-Yen Kuo, and I co-work with Prof. Jian-Jiun Ding and Prof. Yu-Chiang Frank Wang. Currently, I serve as a student research scientist at ASUS Intelligence Cloud Service. I received my Bachelor of Science degree at National Chiao Tung University (NCTU) in 2016, where I was supervised by Prof. Sheng-Chieh Huang and Ching-Cheng Chuang. I served as an exchange student in my senior year at Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden. I have lead several projects in the past three years, and I am a dynamic, easy-going, ambitious, open-minded and optimistic person.
